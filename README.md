# Human-Verified Audio

Human-Verified Audio is a foundational standard for cryptographically verifying
human origin in audio at the moment of creation.

This repository serves as the canonical technical reference for the
Human-Verified Audio concept and lifecycle.

## Concept Overview

Human-Verified Audio establishes provenance at source rather than relying on
post-hoc detection. Verification is bound to the audio file itself and remains
intact through recording, editing, playback, and distribution.

## Lifecycle

- Human capture
- Verification at source
- Cryptographic binding
- Immutable file state
- Editing and mastering
- Playback validation
- Distribution and streaming

## Status

Status: Concept defined.
